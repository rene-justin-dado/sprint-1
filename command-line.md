The command line is, essentially, a more technical way of navigating your computers different files and folders.

Where normally your OS is setup to allow navigating by clicking on icons, the command line displays all visual information through text; like it's describing where you are, rather than providing picture icons.

It also lets you navigate only through text. As in, you must type in where you want to go and what you want to do; this includes navigating to different folders, opening/deleting/creating files, amongst other things that computers can do.
